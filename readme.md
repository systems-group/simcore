# SimCore

SimCore is discrete-event simulation framework aimed to provide a solid foundation for building simulation models of
distributed and other kinds of systems. The framework is built around a generic event-driven programming model that can
be used to model different domains. It allows to use both callbacks and asynchronous waiting to conveniently model any
execution logic.
