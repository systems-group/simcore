# SimCore

SimCore is discrete event simulation framework aimed to provide a solid foundation for building simulation models of distributed systems. The framework is built around a generic event-driven [programming model](examples/intro) that can be used to model different domains even beyond distributed systems. It allows to use both callbacks and asynchronous waiting to conveniently model any execution logic. The versatility of SimCore is demonstrated by using it for building several [simulation libraries](https://github.com/osukhoroslov/dslab/tree/main/crates) for research and education.
